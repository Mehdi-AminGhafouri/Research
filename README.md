# code for my Research
====================================
select the branch you looking for from top bar(Shown in the image below)

![branch tab](https://github.com/Mehdi-AminGhafouri/University/blob/main/branch.png)



Why this style:
Repository / each project in different Branch 

I saw many repositories where all the projects were kept in one repository and each project was in its own folder
The point is that if a user needs to download a specific project, he/she should download all your projects, and this is not good at all.
So I like to create a main repository and put each project in a different Branch so any one can download it

This idea is very similar to object-oriented programming in that, for example, we have a class of shapes and we create a derived class for each shapes such as a circle, a square, and so on. . .



Usage:
------
These codes can be useful to complete your project
